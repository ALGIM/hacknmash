# Team 3: More useful minutes and agendas

## Background

Output is to make agendas and minutes for council meetings more user-friendly/accessible. Most people are reluctant to scan through a document that sometimes exceeds 200 pages and are often laden with jargon. People come to find out about a specific issue and follow its progress.

Content around an issue doesn't necessarily have to be buried in a PDF. We're assuming that we can scrape some of this data if it's tagged in the source document, but other related content could be curated on other platforms, linking back to a single page on a council website, the single authoritative source. The level of detail offered would initially be brief (eg. what decision was made), and allowing the visitor to drill down into further detail (eg how each councillor voted) including background detail (useful for media queries) and locations. This could extend to linking to timestamps in audio or video so people can see/hear how topics were debated.

Issues could be followed by a unique hashtag across multiple platforms and/or location, with the ability to subscribe to updates.

## Outcomes
* More transparent around decision making processes
* Better informed and engaged community
* Useful research tool for community and media

## Brainstorm

* Users' interest is in the content of the agenda - not necessarily the agenda itself, which can be 200+ pages.
* Find info through search
* Must be responsive and lightweight, recognising some users could be on flaky 3G connections.
* Document structure/styling not applied
* Information tagged appropriately, issue/topic, location, meeting, organisation 
* Tagging timestamps on audio/video
* Council legalese isn't user-friendly. Re-purpose plain language versions from media releases.
* Hashtag subscription to issue-focused updates
* High level result, drill down to details (which way councillors voted), debate video/audio, transcript, issue timeline (eg. storify).
* Tagging segments of content inside source document (assumed to be PDF for this exercise).
